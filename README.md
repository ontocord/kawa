Tens of thousands of contributors have taken some time to teach facts to computers. Their pseudonyms can be found in the "sources" list found in ConceptNet's raw data and in its API.

Games with a Purpose Data collected from Verbosity, one of the CMU "Games with a Purpose", is used and released under ConceptNet's license, by permission from Luis von Ahn and Harshit Surana.

Verbosity players are anonymous, so in the "sources" list, data from Verbosity is simply credited to the pseudonym "verbosity".

Wikimedia projects ConceptNet uses data directly from Wiktionary, the free dictionary. It also uses data from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia via DBPedia.

Wiktionary and Wikipedia are collaborative projects, authored by their respective online communities. They are currently released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.

Wikimedia encourages giving attribution by providing links to the hosted pages that the data came from, and DBPedia asks for the same thing in turn. In addition to crediting the assertions that came from Wiktionary and DBPedia, we also provide "ExternalURL" edges pointing to the page that they came from. For example, the term /c/de/sprache has an ExternalURL link pointing to http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sprache. Its list of individual contributors can be seen by following its "History" link.

The URLs of links to DBPedia are the same as the resource names that DBPedia uses, encouraging interoperability with their linked data.
